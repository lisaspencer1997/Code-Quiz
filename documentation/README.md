## Project status
Acceptance criteria complete. No bugs.

## Name
Lisa Spencer: Code Quiz

## Description
This page is the challenge/homework for Week 6 of my Bootcamp course. The aim is to create an online quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Instructors and TAs informed that the quiz can be on any subject so I have chosen the TV Show: "Friends" as the subject! The challenge asks us to build a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. 

The quiz must contain the following requirements:

* A start button that, when clicked, a timer starts and the first question appears.
 
  * Questions contain buttons for each answer.
  * When an answer is clicked, the next question appears.
  * If the answer clicked was incorrect, then subtract time from the clock

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

  * When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
